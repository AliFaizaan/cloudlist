Cloudlist is a multi-cloud tool for getting Assets (Hostnames, IP Addresses) from Cloud Providers. This is intended to be used by the blue team to augment Attack Surface Management efforts by maintaining a centralized list of assets across multiple clouds with very little configuration efforts.

```

### From Source

**cloudlist** requires **go1.14+** to install successfully. Run the following command to get the repo - 

```sh
â–¶ GO111MODULE=on go get -u -v github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist/cmd/cloudlist
```

### From Github

```sh
â–¶ git clone https://github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist.git; cd cloudlist/cmd/cloudlist; go build; cp cloudlist /usr/local/bin/; cloudlist -version
```

# Configuration file

The default config file should be located in `$HOME/.config/cloudlist/config.yaml` and has the following contents as an example. In order to run this tool, the keys need to updated in the config file.

```yaml

# Configuration file for cloudlist enumeration agent
- # provider is the name of the provider (Digitalocean)
  provider: do
  # profile is the name of the provider profile
  profile: xxxx
  # digitalocean_token is the API key for digitalocean cloud platform
  digitalocean_token: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

- # provider is the name of the provider (Scaleway)
  provider: scw
  # scaleway_access_key is the access key for scaleway API
  scaleway_access_key: SCWXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  # scaleway_access_token is the access token for scaleway API
  scaleway_access_token: xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx

- # provider is the name of the provider (Amazon Web Services)
  provider: aws
  # profile is the name of the provider profile
  profile: staging
  # aws_access_key is the access key for AWS account
  aws_access_key: AKIAXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
  # aws_secret_key is the secret key for AWS account
  aws_secret_key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

- # provider is the name of the provider (Google Cloud Platform)
  provider: gcp
  # profile is the name of the provider profile
  profile: logs
  # gcp_service_account_key is the minified json of a google cloud service account with list permissions
  gcp_service_account_key: '{xxxxxxxxxxxxx}'
```

# Running cloudlist

```
â–¶ cloudlist
```

This will list all the assets from configured providers in the configuration file. Specific providers and asset type can also be specified using available flags.

```bash

â–¶ cloudlist -provider aws

## Running cloudlist with Nuclei

Scanning assets from various cloud providers with nuclei for security assessments:- 

```bash
â–¶ cloudlist -silent | httpx -silent | nuclei -t cves/
```

# Supported providers

- AWS (Amazon web services)
  - EC2
  - Route53
- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)
  - Cloud DNS
- DO (DigitalOcean)
  - Instances
- SCW (Scaleway)
  - Instances

To see how to configure providers, check [PROVIDERS.md](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist/blob/main/PROVIDERS.md).

# Todo

- [ ] Add support for Azure platform

# Cloudlist as a library

It's possible to use the library directly in your go programs. The following code snippets outline how to list assets from all or given cloud provider.

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	"github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist/pkg/inventory"
	"github.com/projectdiscovery/cloudlist/pkg/schema"
)

func main() {
	inventory, err := inventory.New(schema.Options{
		schema.OptionBlock{"provider": "digitalocean", "digitalocean_token": "ec405badb974fd3d891c9223245f9ab5871c127fce9e632c8dc421edd46d7242"},
	})
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("%s\n", err)
	}

	for _, provider := range inventory.Providers {
		resources, err := provider.Resources(context.Background())
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("%s\n", err)
		}
		for _, resource := range resources.Items {
			_ = resource // Do something with the resource
		}
	}
}
```
